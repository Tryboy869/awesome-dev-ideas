## 🎓 DOI and Academic Citation

While this license allows free use of ideas, we **strongly encourage** contributors to:

1. Register their ideas on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [HAL](https://hal.science) to obtain a DOI
2. Include the DOI in their idea's `author.doi` field
3. Cite ideas appropriately when building upon them

**This is not a legal requirement, but a community norm.**
